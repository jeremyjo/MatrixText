# MatrixText
A project to apply my Javascript knowledge. Attempts to emulate the code that flows down in The Matrix movies, but allows the English language characters, numbers, and symbols.

# Summary
The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a webpage that allows users to type letters, numbers, and symbols. Once typed, the input will fall down the screen similar to the way the code falls down in The Matrix movies. Users have the ability to wait around 1 second after typing for the animation to occur, or they can press the Enter Key to start the animation.

# Responsive
Works for mobile and large screens. For mobile screens, there will be an input box that the user can type their text into. For large screens, user can start typing as long as the website is the active screen.
